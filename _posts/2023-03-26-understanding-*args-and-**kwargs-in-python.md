As a Python programmer, you may have come across the terms *args and \*\*kwargs. While these two concepts are similar in some ways, they have distinct differences and use cases. In this article, we will explore the definition, differences, and use cases of *args and \*\*kwargs.

Definition
_args is a special syntax in Python used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. The _ character before the argument name unpacks the arguments into a tuple.

On the other hand, **kwargs is another special syntax in Python used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. The ** character before the argument name unpacks the keyword arguments into a dictionary.

Difference
While both *args and \*\*kwargs are used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function, they differ in the type of arguments they accept. *args is used for passing a variable number of non-keyword arguments, whereas \*\*kwargs is used for passing a variable number of keyword arguments.

Use Cases
The use cases of \*args and \*\*kwargs are varied, and they are commonly used in situations where a function needs to accept a variable number of arguments.

Text 2: Examples of *args and \*\*kwargs in Python
*args
When a function needs to accept a variable number of non-keyword arguments.
When you want to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function.

{% highlight ruby %}
def concatenate(\*args):
result = ""
for arg in args:
result += arg
return result

print(concatenate("hello", "world", "!"))
{% endhighlight %}
